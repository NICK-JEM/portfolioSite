# portfolioSite 
```HTML CSS JavaScript```

## A personal portfolio static website created as part of a codecademy project.

The project is a static website designed for me to upload project summaries
for those I have completed so far. It will be used to track my progress with
coding and show off my abilities to interested parties.

The project is unguided aside from a few tips and a Kanban board to track
task completion (on the codecademy platform). All coding work my own, including 
bugs and errors!

### NOTES (for own tracking. will delete upon completion of project)

However I will update this readme as I complete sections.
