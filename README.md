# portfolioSite 
```HTML CSS JavaScript```

      
## A personal portfolio static website created as part of a codecademy project.

The project is a static website designed for me to upload project summaries
for those I have completed so far. It will be used to track my progress with
coding and show off my abilities to interested parties.

The project is unguided aside from a few tips and a Kanban board to track
task completion (on the codecademy platform). All coding work my own, including bugs and errors!

## functionality issues

* There is a basic level of responsive functionality, however no extra media
  queries added to improve it for this project. 

* Dark/Light modes and Colorblind modes are available for Home page, however 
  they will not stay active between pages as I have not set cookies. font 
  change to sans-serif to improve readability in dark mode. redGreen is default
  color scheme, and Total is a greyscale but it is unneccessary as I used 
  several hues of a single color.

* most of my wireframed design has been implemented, however the diagonals 
  could be smoother and element spacing more consistent with page resize.
  
## final notes
```
As of deployment on github pages: completed colorblind and dark modes for testing only on 
the home page as I could not separate the javascript functions into a different file, 
and the other pages don't have the toggles. Would implement the toggles in the banner
in future. 

added a small screenshot of several of the screens i took for my uni final year project, 
and a short summary of function. did not add detail to the projects page.

in future projects I would start with the media queries to specify device screen size, as 
my site looks very small on mobile. functions work as expected, but there is a slight
issue with the :visited styling on the nav.

timeframe was not sufficient as I did not factor in my personal life commitments, therefore
actual coding, debug and adjustments took approx. 7 days, but only 4-5hrs of each of them, so
around 35hrs to complete.

conclusion: While my site meets the brief (and some parts exceed specs), I am unhappy with the
disjointed nature of the mode toggles and the small sizes on mobile devices. However this is
only a template until I deploy a "true" portfolio website, to show some of my capability 
thus far as a novice coder.

### NOTES (for own tracking. left notes in for future reference)

As of last commit there is only a skeleton of a Home page and some styling, 
However I will update this readme as I complete sections.
