## A personal portfolio static website created as part of a codecademy project.

The project is a static website designed for me to upload project summaries
for those I have completed so far. It will be used to track my progress with
coding and show off my abilities to interested parties.

As of last commit there is only a skeleton of a Home page and some styling, 
However I will update this readme as I complete sections.
